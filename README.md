# Luganda-KWS
This is our Fourth year project.
The aim of this project is to create a keyword spotting system that can run on resource constricted systems for a group of keywords. The intention of this is to be able to identify a group of keywords in the Luganda language and also carry out these commands on any system this application runs on.
A dataset we worked with has been uploaded to this link.

Below is the procedure to undertake when setting up the application
1.Place all the cleaned dataset in a folder, Dataset. Make sure each keyword is under its own folder for example Dataset\Kuba
2.Run the prepare_dataset.py file 
3.A data.json file should populate containing the MFCCs, labels  and for the keywords present in the dataset
